ALGORITHM FOR FINDING FACTORS OF A NUMBER
Proposed Solution #1 by C.G

Get a list of all numbers from 1 and the number you want to factor (which will will call g)
For every number, split the list of numbers (1 to g) into that number amount of columns

LEGEND:
g: number you want to factor
n: the number that is being factorised
For Example:
1                                                   1 2
2                                                   3 4
3                                                   5 6 >Factoring g and seeing if 2 is a factor of g
4                                                   7 8
5  >Factoring 10 and seeing if 1 is a factor of 10. 9 10
6                                                   ..g
7
8
9
10

If the number (n) is divisible by g, then continue on by incrementing n by 1 and then splitting the list into n columns
For Example:
1  2  3  4  5                   1  2  3  4   5   6
6  7  8  9  10     >BECOMES>    7  8  9  10  11  12
11 12 13 14 15                  13 14 15

However, if n is NOT divisible by g, put a marker (that makes sure that the computer knows it in indivisible by g) in every element of the last column
Make the marker 'm'
For Example:
1 2 3             1 2 3m             1  2  3m  4
4 5 6 > BECOMES > 4 5 6m > BECOMES > 5  6m  7  8
7 8 9             7 8 9m             9m 10
10                10

Now, the computer knows which number NOT to put in the list.

This will continue until the number of columns is equal to g. Once that happens, replace every divider (in this case it was a space seperating the columns) with newlines.
For Example:

1 2m 3 4m 5 6m 7m 8m 9m 10m 11m 12m 13m 14m 15 > BECOMES > 1
                                                           2m
                                                           3
                                                           4m
                                                           5
                                                           6m
                                                           7m
                                                           8m
                                                           9m
                                                           10m
                                                           11m
                                                           12m
                                                           13m
                                                           14m
                                                           15

Which can be done using the command tr ' ' '\n'
The computer will delete all lines with 'm' in it which can be done by doing sed '/m/d'
This deletes all lines with 'm' in it.

(NOT YET OPTIMIZED) METHOD:
for i in $(jot - 1 $1) #For all values 1 to first value (the number 
do
n[$i]=$i #All values are mapped onto array n starting from one. N âˆˆ natural numbers(1 is stored in n[1], 2 in n[2] etc.)
done
while [ $i -le $1 ]
do

done

OPTIONAL:
Make the program search for factors less than (g/2) + 1
